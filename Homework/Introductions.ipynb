    "* I'm enrolled in class to gain techniques in analyzing genomic data. I have an intership during the summer at JGI and it most likely will have genomic data. I enrolled in this class to boost my confidence a little in bioinformatics since I currently don't know much about the different techniques in bioinformatics.\n",

    "* I am looking into bioinformatics, biostatistics, and biomedical informatics programs. \n",
